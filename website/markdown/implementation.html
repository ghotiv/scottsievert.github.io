This video is of the app actually running on an iPhone 5.

<p>This theory of grouping the detail terms with the noise was implemented in an
iOS application, called <a href="https://www.github.com/scottsievert/isparse">iSparse</a> which is available on the App Store.
This app allows the user to select a sampling rate as well as the number of
ignored detail levels.</p>

<p>Any picture can be chosen from the user’s camera roll, meaning this
reconstruction is taking place on the seemingly underpowered mobile device.
The power of signal processing techniques is then apparent, and our hope is to
show and inspire researchers in other fields.</p>
