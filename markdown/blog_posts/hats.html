<p>Often times, intuition suggests an answer to a problem. However, that answer
can be wrong and have a deeper cause than the simple surface analysis predicts.</p>

<p>For example, suppose we have two people. An infinite number of hats fall upon
their heads. These hats are of two colors, blue and black. Suppose they want to
guess the same color hat but can't see each other. Intuition says they have a
probability of $1/4$ of guessing correctly. However, the real answer is
different and lies with a much deeper fact.</p>
