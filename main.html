<p>I'm rather interested in adaptive sampling and the new techniques compressed
sensing brings to the table. There are interesting places to look in any
signal, and most of our energy (aka time or money) should be focused there. </p>

<p>For example, thermal images are relatively simple; why not focus on the edges?
That's where the detail, the most pertinent information lies. Or determining
ages from a family portrait: the faces hold the information we're interested
in. Prof. Jarvis Haupt, the advisor of my lab, has done a <a href="http://nuit-blanche.blogspot.com/2013/08/sahd-compressive-saliency-sensing.html">great talk</a> on
finding the most interesting information.</p>

<p>This concept of detecting and estimating data present in a signal and using it
to your advantage seems so natural and fascinates me, the reason I'll be
getting my PhD in it. My most up to date "course of life," my CV, is available <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/9s4yvz6mjc7x41a/CV.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>My <a href="https://github.com/scottsievert?tab=repositories">Github</a> contains almost all of the code I work on. It has everything
from research activities to small projects to this website.</p>
