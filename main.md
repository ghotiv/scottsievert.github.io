I'm rather interested in adaptive sampling and the new techniques compressed
sensing brings to the table, but that really doesn't tell you much. What it
means is that there are interesting places to look in any signal, and most of
our energy should be focused there. For example, thermal images are relatively
simple; why not focus on the edges? Or determining ages from a family portrait:
the faces hold the most information.

This concept of detecting and estimating data present in a signal and using it
to your advantage seems so natural and fascinates me, the reason I'll be
getting my PhD in it. My most up to date "course of life," my CV, is available [here][CV].

For example, faces contain the most important and unique data about age, or a
brain scan may have a tumor or a baggage scan might contain a weapon. There a
[great talk][talk] on this by Prof. Jarvis Haupt, the advisor of our lab.

My [Github][git] contains almost all of the code I work on. It has everything
from research activities to small projects to this website.
