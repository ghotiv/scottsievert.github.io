I'm rather interested in compressed sensing and adaptive sampling, but that
doesn't tell you much. What it means is it's of interest to pull all the
information you can out of the signal. To any interesting real world signal,
there are interesting and uninteresting part; why focus on the uninteresting
parts? 

This concept of detecting and estimating data present in a signal and using it
to your advantage seems so natural and fascinates me, the reason I'll be
getting my PhD in it. My most up to date "course of life," my CV, is available [here][CV].

For example, faces contain the most important and unique data about age, or a
brain scan may have a tumor or a baggage scan might contain a weapon. There a
[great talk][talk] on this by Prof. Jarvis Haupt, the advisor of our lab.

My [Github][git] contains almost all of the code I work on. It has everything
from research activities to small projects to this website.
