<h3>Thermal Camera</h3>

<p>Current thermal cameras, meaning infrared (IR) cameras are often very expensive
(4,000-40,000 dollars), but a Raspberry Pi, stepper motors,  single sensor
and some complicated signal processing is only about 400 bucks. Making a camera
that goes to <em>every</em> pixel location is easy, but results in a <a href="https://raw.github.com/scottsievert/IRcamera/master/temp.rpi/IRcamera/full.png">not-so-great
picture</a> and a long exposure time. Using edge detection through the
Haar wavelet transform, we're able to get a better image with a shorter
exposure time and less cost.</p>

<h3>iPhone app</h3>

<p>Under the direction of Prof. Jarvis Haupt, I have made <a href="https://github.com/scottsievert/iSparse">an app</a> to show other
cross-disciplinary fields what is possible with signal processing. It takes an
image, then randomly deletes some data and then reconstructs the original
image through the Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA). This
work is parallel in many ways to image in-painting, but has much broader
implications.</p>

<h3>Granular Flows</h3>

<p>I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/scottsievert/Granular-Flows-Image-Analysis">C++ program</a> to analyze a granular flow of
two different sized sands. This analysis required the use of a high speed
camera and tracked many different sand particles (using a light's reflection).
It converted to real units, corrected for camera distortion, found the flow
direction and elimented erronous date -- an intensive process. Because this
anaylsis tracked so many particles, it took a long time. I deployed the
computer vision program (which I modified) to find these particles on Amazon's
EC2 servers to reduce the computation time.</p>
