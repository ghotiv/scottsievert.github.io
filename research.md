### Thermal Camera
Current thermal cameras, meaning infrared (IR) cameras are often very expensive
(4,000-40,000 dollars), but a Raspberry Pi, stepper motors,  single sensor
and some complicated signal processing is only about 400 bucks. Making a camera
that goes to *every* pixel location is easy, but results in a [not-so-great
picture][bad_pic] and a long exposure time. Using edge detection through the
Haar wavelet transform, we're able to get a better image with a shorter
exposure time and less cost.
