<h3>THIS IS A HEADER</h3>

<p>I'm rather interested in adaptive sampling and the new techniques compressed sensing brings to the table, but that really doesn't tell you much. What it means is that there are interesting places to look in any signal, and most of our energy should be focused there. For example, thermal images are relatively simple; why not focus on the edges? Or determining ages from a family portrait: the faces hold the most information.</p>

<p>This concept of detecting and estimating data present in a signal and using it to your advantage seems so natural and fascinates me, the reason I'll be getting my PhD in it. My most up to date "course of life," my CV, is available here.</p>

<p>For example, faces contain the most important and unique data about age, or a brain scan may have a tumor or a baggage scan might contain a weapon. There a great talk on this by Prof. Jarvis Haupt, the advisor of our lab.</p>

<p>My Github contains almost all of the code I work on. It has everything from research activities to small projects to this website.</p>

<p>Some more text?</p>
