I'm rather interested in adaptive sampling and the new techniques compressed
sensing brings to the table. There are interesting places to look in any
signal, and most of our energy (aka time or money) should be focused there.

For example, thermal images are relatively simple; why not focus on the edges? That's where the detail, the most pertinent information lies. Or determining ages from a family portrait: the faces hold the information we're interested in. Prof. Jarvis Haupt, the advisor of our lab, has done [a great talk][talk] on finding the most interesting information.


This concept of detecting and estimating data present in a signal and using it to your advantage seems so natural and fascinates me, the reason I'll be getting my doctorate in it. My most up to date "course of life," my CV, is available [here][CV].

### Projects
My [Github][git] contains almost all of the code I work on. It has everything from research activities to small projects to this website.

#### Useful projects of mine: 

* [python-drawnow][drawnow]. Similar to MATLAB's `drawnow`.
* [swix]. A matrix and machine learning library for Swift.
* [jem-press]. A site generator designed with academic website in mind inspired
  by [jem-doc].
